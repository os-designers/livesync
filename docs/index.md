# LiveSync

LiveSync is Keras-inspired asynchronous stream processing framework for building real-time media applications. LiveSync provides a flexible layer system for creating both synchronous and asynchronous media processing pipelines.

## Why LiveSync?

- **Layer-Based Architecture**: Build complex processing pipelines using a Keras-inspired layer system
- **Async-First Design**: Built from the ground up for asynchronous stream processing
- **Media Processing**: Optimized for real-time audio and video processing
- **Flexible Stream System**: Support for both synchronous and asynchronous data flows
- **Remote Processing**: Built-in gRPC support for distributed processing
